# Modler
Modler is a simple oneclick-like mod installer for Beat Saber mods from Github.

# Installation
### PC/laptop part
1. Unpack `modler.zip` from [releases](https://github.com/StormPacer/Modler/releases/latest) in a separate folder. **THE FOLDER SHOULD NOT CONTAIN ANY SPACES IN IT'S NAME!**
2. Run `registerProtocol.exe`. This will make a new protocol on your PC/laptop so modler can be opened straight from the browser.
### Browser part
1. Install a userscript manager. It can be either [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) or [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Install the modler userscript from [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/446675-modler).

# Usage
Now that you've installed everything, you should see an "install mod" button at the top right of any repository. When you press it you will be prompted to open `Windows Command Processor`. When you open it, the app will run and install your mod straight to your Beat Saber directory.

**IF YOU SEE THE FOLLOWING:**
![customDirectory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StormPacer/Modler/main/images/customDirectory.png)

Simply copy paste the path to AppData in your windows search bar and open `customDirectory.txt`. Navigate to your custom Beat Saber directory and copy the path to it by clicking on the path in the top:

![Path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StormPacer/Modler/main/images/path.png)

Then paste that path in `customDirectory.txt`, save the file and you're done. You can now install mods normally.
